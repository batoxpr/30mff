•Project name:	30MFF – Website Assignment - Bato

•	Project Description: Our film is shot in a simple vlog style. 
To reflect the simplicity of the content, I wanted to focus on a minimalistic design, with small intricate details and interactivity. 
To set the "morning vlog" theme, I chose color pallete consisting of pastel blue and yellow. 

•	Process: I mainly used Adobe XD to design the logos and objects of my website. 
For the premiere,  embedded the youtube video to the page as it seemed like a better solution. 
I additionally made use of Adobe Photoshop to create an animated backgrounds and objects. 
To implement the mouse-hover interactions, I used CSS styling tools. 

•	Reflection/Evaluation: While there were many confusing challenges I encountered, I managed to overcome them in the end. 
The whole project made me realize the importance of learning from each trials and errors. 
I also understood the value of repetition, to become more fluent in whatever mark-up/coding language I'm learning.
